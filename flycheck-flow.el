;;; Commentary:

;; This package adds support for flow to flycheck. It requires
;; flow>=0.20.0.

;; To use it, add to your init.el:

;; (require 'flycheck-flow)
;; (add-hook 'javascript-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)

;; You want to use flow in conjunction with other JS checkers. E.g. to
;; use with gjslint, add this to your init.el
;; (flycheck-add-next-checker 'javascript-gjslint 'javascript-flow)
